# Uber Rides Analysis 🚖📊

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to extract insights on ride trends, time-based usage patterns, and supply-demand gaps. The analysis was performed using Python, with the goal of visualizing patterns that can help improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available and contains Uber rides data from New York City for April–September 2014.

**Features include:**
- `Date/Time`: Timestamp of the ride
- `Lat`, `Lon`: Latitude and longitude of the pickup
- `Base`: Base code affiliated with the ride
- Additional extracted features: Hour, Day, Weekday, etc.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Understand hourly, daily, and monthly ride distribution
- Visualize geospatial pickup density using heatmaps
- Identify peak demand hours and days
- Detect ride trends based on base companies
- Suggest operational improvements based on insights

## 📈 Highlights of the Analysis

- **Peak Ride Hours**: Most rides occurred between **5 PM and 7 PM**, indicating post-office hour rush.
- **Day of Week Trends**: **Fridays and Saturdays** showed the highest demand.
- **Monthly Growth**: A steady increase in ride volume was observed from April to September.
- **Base-wise Contribution**: Certain bases like **B02512 and B02617** consistently dominated the ride count.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Ride pickups were highly concentrated in Manhattan and downtown areas.

## 📍 Visualization Samples

- Heatmaps of pickup locations
- Hourly ride distribution bar charts
- Monthly and daily ride frequency graphs
- Base code-wise analysis

## ✅ Conclusion

The project demonstrates how data analysis can uncover patterns in urban mobility. By leveraging such insights, ride-sharing companies like Uber can optimize driver allocation, improve service availability, and better manage surge pricing.

## 📌 Future Scope

- Include weather or traffic data for deeper insights.
- Predictive modeling for ride demand.
- Dashboard deployment using Streamlit or Power BI.
